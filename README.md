🚀 Example Code Snippets
Here are some sample functions included in this repository:

🟢 1. Sum of Two Numbers (Arrow Function)

    const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8

🟢 2. Check Even or Odd (Ternary Operator)

    const isEven = (num) => num % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";
    console.log(isEven(4)); // Output: Even

🟢 3. Looping Through an Array

    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2)); // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
